# Rossman Drug Stores Sales Forecasting
This project focuses on building time series based sales forecasing using Machine Learning models.

# Problem Statment
Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied. To overcome this problem, the company has requested to forecast Sales data

# Objectives
- Build a forecasting model to forecast the daily sales for the next six weeks (42 days)
- Prepare models specifically for 9 key stores: 1, 3, 8, 9, 13, 25, 29, 31, and 46
